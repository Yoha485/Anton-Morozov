      As a Software developer I try to be as flexible as possible. My main focus is on the front-end, but I also have
      experience on the back-end side.
      <br />
      <br />I currently live in Poland and I&apos;m looking for opportunities that will allow me to grow as a developer
      and as a person and contribute to meaningful projects
      <br />
      <br />I am passionate about staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies, always seeking ways
      to enhance my skill set. Whether it&apos;s exploring new libraries, adopting best practices in software
      architecture, or diving into cloud technologies, I thrive on continuous learning.
